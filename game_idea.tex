    \frametitle{PROJECT DESCRIPTION}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A time travel adventure game where the player must find a lost key to return to the present.
        \item The player’s time machine malfunctions, causing them to land in an unknown timeline.
        \item The player must navigate through various historical or futuristic settings to find the key.
        \item After completing certain levels and get the key, the player will return to the present and completes the game.
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{FEATURES}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Player Movement}: Navigation of Character and Camera through arrow keys, Collision Detection and Rotation.
        \item \textbf{3D Environment}: Maze generation using Recursive Backtracking Algorithm and converion of 2D map to 3D. 
        \item \textbf{3D Environment}: Use of realistic wall and floor textures and skybox integration
        \item \textbf{Minimap}: The minimap updates in real-time to reflect the player’s current position within the maze.
        \item \textbf{Minimap}: The minimap has an end-marker, and reflects the maze's layout accurately.
        \item \textbf{Camera}: The third-person camera provides an follow up to the character making the user to easily control the character.
        \item \textbf{Audio Integration}: Sound effects are triggered when the player collides with walls or reaches the end of the maze.
        \item \textbf{User Interface}: Addition of loading screen and responsive design makes it easy for different device widths.
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{CHALLENGES FACED}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Collision Detection}: Used bounding boxes(THREE.Box3), optimized collision checks.
        \item \textbf{Character loading}: Had issues with rendering the scene before models/textures fully load.
        \item \textbf{Minimap generation}: Integrating 2D elements like minimaps with the 3D scene was more challenging than rendering 3D scene.
        \item \textbf{3D Map implementation}: Mapping 2D maze to 3D walls.
        \item \textbf{Sound Effects and Character handling}: Adding sounds and modelling the character.
        \item \textbf{Project Management}: Managing timeline of all the team members.
        \item \textbf{Error Handling and Debugging}: Used try-catch blocks, logged errors, debugged with browser tools.
    \end{itemize}
